# We Need Freedom, We Have to Stop Technology War

In our last class, we discussed various technologies, which might have left some feeling overwhelmed about how to learn them all. Don't worry; you don't need to master everything at once. The best way to learn technology is gradually. Start with HTML basics, then move to CSS, and so on. Skipping parts that you don't understand initially is okay; you'll eventually understand them as you progress. Here's a guide on how to approach learning different technologies and understanding programming paradigms.

## Today's Agenda

- We need freedom, we need to stop technology war
- Why do we need programming languages?
- Why different programming languages for client & server?
- Understanding programming paradigms
- Programming is always the same, but the language varies

## Why Do We Need Programming Languages?

To build an application, you typically follow these steps:

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
   - UI/UX Design
   - Web Design
   - Frontend Development
   - Backend Development
   - Test Code
4. Testing and Deployment
5. Maintenance

Programming languages are mainly required during the Implementation step, specifically for frontend and backend development. Essentially, programming languages allow us to write code that the computer can understand to solve real-life problems.

## Why Different Programming Languages for Client & Server?

If all programming languages are for communicating with computers, why do we need so many? The answer lies in the specific needs of different companies and contexts. For example, JavaScript was developed for adding interactivity to HTML in browsers, while Java was created for running programs on portable devices.

### Client-Side (Browser)

Browsers, which are software within computers, primarily support JavaScript for interactivity. Hence, for frontend development, JavaScript is indispensable. If a new browser supports Python, then Python would be necessary for frontend work.

### Server-Side (Backend)

Servers are essentially computers, so they can run any programming language. Historically, different languages were used for client and server until Node.js enabled JavaScript to be used on the server as well. This allows developers to use the same language for both frontend and backend development.

For mobile, iOS restricts to Swift and Objective-C, while Android allows multiple languages, including C++, Kotlin, and Java.

## Understanding Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms categorize programming languages based on their approach to solving problems. The main paradigms are Imperative and Declarative.

### Imperative Paradigm

In this paradigm, the programmer gives specific instructions on how to change the program state. It's further divided into Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

- **Procedural Programming:** Groups instructions into procedures without logical grouping.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Groups instructions into classes, allowing for logical grouping and reusability.

### Declarative Paradigm

In this paradigm, the programmer declares the properties of the desired result, not how to compute it. This includes Functional Programming, Logic Programming, Mathematical Programming, and Reactive Programming.

## Summary

- Client-side development primarily requires JavaScript due to browser limitations.
- Server-side development can use any language since it runs on a computer.
- iOS restricts to Swift and Objective-C, while Android is more flexible.
- Understanding programming paradigms helps in adapting to different languages easily.

By understanding these concepts and gradually learning each technology, you can overcome the fear of learning too many things at once.
